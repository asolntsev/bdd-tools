Before running the test you will need to download [ChromeDriver](https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/) implementation for your OS  
and update the pom.xml `webdriver.chrome.driver` property with this path.    
To run the tests use:    
        `mvn clean test`    

Or directly from your IDE (not forgetting to set env variables from pom file).
